# Simple Rules of the black-jack game.

♠️  Unlike most card games, Blackjack is played against the dealer, not other players. That’s the first thing that’s a bit different.

♥️  At the start, the dealer deals two cards to each player and themselves.

♣️  All of the cards are revealed – turned face up – other than one of the dealer’s cards. Simply, each card is worth the number value attached to it — 2 is worth 2, 3 is worth 3, 4 is worth 4, etc., and face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10.

♦️  Aces can be worth either 1 or 11 and the dealer announces whether Aces are high – worth 11, or low – only worth 1.

♠️  Each player looks at their cards and has the option to ‘hit’ – which means going for another card, or ‘standing’, which means sticking with what they have.

♥️  The aim is for the sum of the cards to be as close to 21 as possible, but never going over, as that means you go ‘bust.’

♣️  The winner is the person who is closest to 21 – so a 10 and a 9 would win against a Jack and a 6.
